# Members Only Assignment for The Odin Project

## Things I learned

There were many parts of this assignment that was just building upon the previous assignment of using nodeJS, express, postgresql, and deploying. The main thing I learned from this project was the use of passportJS and express-sessions to validate the user as well as logging them. I verified the data provided by the user session and was able to make requests to a database as well as allow/deny specific routes based on a user's status as a not logged in/logged in/member/admin.

I also learned about hashing a password, salting it to ensure there's randomness to that hash so that even if two passwords are the same, the salt ensures the hashes will be different. I also learned how to automatically re-arrange tailwind classes so that they always appear in the same order to ensure it's easier to read and parse.
